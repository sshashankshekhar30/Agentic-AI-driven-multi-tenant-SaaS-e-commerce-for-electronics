Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python projects involves using a library or framework to bridge the gap between object-oriented Python code and relational databases. This allows developers to interact with database tables as if they were Python objects, abstracting away the need to write raw SQL queries. 
Here's how ORM is typically done in Python projects: 

• Choosing an ORM Library: 
	• Django ORM: Tightly integrated with the Django web framework, it's a popular choice for Django projects. 
	• SQLAlchemy: A powerful and flexible ORM that can be used with any Python project, offering both a high-level ORM and a low-level SQL Expression Language. 
	• Pony ORM: Known for its expressive query syntax and concise model definitions. 
	• Tortoise ORM: An asynchronous ORM designed for use with async web frameworks like FastAPI and Sanic. 

• Defining Models: 
	• You define Python classes that represent your database tables. These classes are often called "models." 
	• Each attribute of the model class typically maps to a column in the corresponding database table. 
	• The ORM handles the mapping of data types between Python and the database. 

    # Example with SQLAlchemy
    from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

    Base = declarative_base()

    class User(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'users'
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        name = Column(String)
        email = Column(String)

• Connecting to the Database: 
	• You configure the ORM to connect to your chosen database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite). This involves specifying connection details like the database URL, username, and password. 

    # Example with SQLAlchemy
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    engine = create_engine('sqlite:///example.db')
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine) # Creates tables if they don't exist

• Performing CRUD Operations: 
	• Create: Instantiate model objects and add them to the ORM session for persistence. 
	• Read: Use ORM methods (e.g., filter(), get(), all()) to query the database and retrieve objects based on criteria. 
	• Update: Modify attributes of retrieved objects and commit the changes. 
	• Delete: Delete objects from the database through the ORM. 

    # Example with SQLAlchemy
    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()

    # Create
    new_user = User(name='Alice', email='alice@example.com')
    session.add(new_user)
    session.commit()

    # Read
    users = session.query(User).filter_by(name='Alice').all()
    for user in users:
        print(f"User ID: {user.id}, Name: {user.name}")

    # Update
    user_to_update = session.query(User).filter_by(name='Alice').first()
    if user_to_update:
        user_to_update.email = 'alice.new@example.com'
        session.commit()

    # Delete
    user_to_delete = session.query(User).filter_by(name='Alice').first()
    if user_to_delete:
        session.delete(user_to_delete)
        session.commit()

    session.close()

• Managing Relationships: 
	• ORMs provide ways to define relationships between models (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) and handle related data retrieval. 

By using an ORM, Python developers can focus on object-oriented programming concepts rather than database-specific SQL syntax, making database interactions more intuitive and often more maintainable.
